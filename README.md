### Suggestions:
- We need more call to action buttons on the home page.
    - Add a button under about section?
- Make the prehover games fully grey and white
- Actually maybe we dont add a Home navlink (im so sorry)
- Want to add a hover effect to the ig posts? maybe b&w to color on hover?

### Restraints for the first itteration:
- Cant make Discord icon new ??
- Cant make active navbar :((
- cant have the lion be a separate img in hero (unless navbar is fixed i think)
